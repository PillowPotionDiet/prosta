<p>Your privacy is critically important to us.</p>
<p>It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
while operating our

<p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
information you may
provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain
what information may
be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may
disclose the information
to third parties.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and
does not apply to
our collection of information from other sources.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set
forth the

<p>Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required
to agree to
additional terms and conditions.</p>
<h2 class="main-title mb-2">Website Visitors</h2>

information of the sort
that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
preference, referring site,
and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
information is to
better understand how our visitors use our website.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the
aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of our website.</p>
<p>We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses
for logged in users and for users leaving comments on blog posts.</p>
<p>We only disclose logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances
that we use and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
<h2 class="main-title mb-2">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to this website choose to interact in ways that
require us to
gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends
on the nature of
the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a newsletter to provide their email
address.</p>

but remember that
no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While
we strive to use
commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
security.</p>
<h2 class="main-title mb-2">Advertisements</h2>
<p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by
advertising partners,
who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they
send you an online
advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information
allows ad networks
to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest
to you. This
Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our website and does not cover the use of cookies by any
advertisers.</p>
<h2 class="main-title mb-2">Links To External Sites</h2>

on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to
review the Privacy
Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
<p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content,
privacy policies or
practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>

(including Google,
Facebook and Others) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous

could be in the
form of an advertisement on search results pages, or a site in the Display Network.</p>

someone’s past
visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and the

the database, so we invite you to wait a reasonable time, in which you may receive service-related announcements.</p>

unauthorized access, use,
alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
