<p>The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites contained in this policy applies to PillowPotion Naturals collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by PillowPotion Naturals on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the “Websites”), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to PillowPotion Naturals other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.</p>

<p><b>1. Collection of Information.</b></p>

<p><b>1.1 Survey Information.</b></p>

<p>PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a “Survey”). (As used herein, “online” means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and “offline” means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites or a third party (a “Third Party”) may ask an individual to provide various information to PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, health history, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, “Survey Information”). PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites.</p>

<p><b>1.2 Other Information.</b></p>

<p>Other occasions when PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites obtain information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites service or newsletter (together, “Other Information”).</p>

<p><b>1.3 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</b></p>

<p>PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, “Technology Information”).</p>

<p><b>(a) Cookies.</b></p>

<p>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual’s computer that allows PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>

<p><b>(b) Web Beacons.</b></p>

<p>A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function — see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioural habits for marketing purposes. For example, PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party’s website where clothing products are sold. When Bob, an individual listed in PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites database, visits the clothing PillowPotion Naturals would then update Bob’s profile with the information that Bob is interested in clothing. PillowPotion Naturals may thereafter present offers of clothing related products and services to Bob. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, PillowPotion Naturals also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in PillowPotion Naturals database.</p>

<p><b>(c) New Technology.</b></p>

<p>The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is PillowPotion Naturals and it’s associated websites use of new and evolving technology.
