</div>
<h2 class="main-title mb-2">Cancel Order</h2>
<div class="div-content">
<p>Due to high order volume a customer's order goes directly into our fulfillment center to be
processed. If the
customer contacts within 24 hours after they purchased they can cancel their order. If the
customer contacts after 24
hours of purchase time then they will not be able to cancel their order. If your order is
already processed or has
already shipped, we cannot cancel the order. Customers will need to either refuse the package
and immediately notify Support@PillowPotion.com the date it was
refused or return the package with a valid tracking number and notify us with said tracking
number so we can verify.
Once we receive the package back to our warehouse and review we will be able to provide a
refund.
</p>
</div>
<h2 class="main-title mb-2">Wrong Address Disclaimer</h2>
<div class="div-content">
<p>It is the responsibility of the buyer to make sure that he or she enters the address correctly.
We cannot guarantee
address changes due to strict shipping schedules. Please double-check the address you are
entering, as we will NOT be
held responsible for packages that are sent to the wrong address that the buyer has entered. If
your order is already
processed or has already shipped, we cannot change the address and the only thing we can do is
wait to see if the
package gets returned back to us. In that case, we will be able to provide you with a re-ship or
refund.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="main-title mb-2">Delivery of Items</h2>
<div class="div-content">

PillowPotion BloodBoost does not offer
refunds if the item is claimed to not have been delivered. If an item is not received when
tracking information
confirms delivery, please contact the designated shipping company USPS for assistance.</p>
